## **API Endpoints**

The application exposes several REST API endpoints using Django REST Framework (DRF). Below are the key endpoints:

  - `POST /api/properties/`: Create a new property (landlord only).
  - `GET /api/properties/<id>/`: View property details.
  
- **Rental Applications**:
  - `GET /api/applications/`: List all applications.
  - `POST /api/applications/`: Create a new rental application (tenant only).
  - `PATCH /api/applications/<id>/`: Update the status of an application (landlord only).

- **Payments**:
  - `POST /api/payments/`: Make a payment (tenant only).

- **Reviews**:
  - `POST /api/reviews/`: Submit a review for a property (tenant only).

### Authentication:
- The API uses **JWT Authentication** and **Session Authentication**. You can obtain a token using the `POST /api/auth/login/` endpoint.

## **CRUD Operations**

This application utilizes the full range of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations across various models. Below is a breakdown of how CRUD is applied:

### **Create**:
- **Properties**: Landlords can create new property listings via the `POST /api/properties/` API and the `property_create` view.
- **Rental Applications**: Tenants can submit rental applications via the `POST /api/applications/` API and the `application_create` view.
- **Payments**: Tenants can make payments for their approved applications via the `POST /api/payments/` API and the `payment_create` view.
- **Reviews**: Tenants can submit reviews for properties via the `POST /api/reviews/` API and the `property_review_create` view.

### **Read**:
- **Properties**: Both tenants and landlords can view property listings. Tenants can view property details, and landlords can see their properties.
- **Rental Applications**: Both tenants and landlords can view applications. Tenants can see their applications, and landlords can view applications for their properties.
- **Payments**: Tenants can view the status of their payments, and landlords can see payment statuses for their properties.
- **Reviews**: Tenants can view reviews for properties.

### **Update**:
- **Rental Applications**: Landlords can update the status of rental applications (e.g., approve or reject) via the `PATCH /api/applications/<id>/` API and `application_update_status` view.
- **Reviews**: Tenants can update their reviews, if needed (based on your business rules).

### **Delete**:
